abstract="The blossoming research field of electronic textiles (or e-textiles) seeks to integrate ubiquitous electronic and computational elements into fabric. This paper concerns one of the most challenging aspects of the design and construction of e-textile prototypes: namely, engineering the attachment of traditional hardware components to textiles. We present three new techniques for attaching off-the-shelf electrical hardware to e-textiles: (a) the design of fabric PCBs or iron-on circuits to attach electronics directly to a fabric substrate; (b) the use of electronic sequins to create wearable displays and other artifacts; and (c) the use of socket buttons to facilitate connecting pluggable devices to textiles. In this work we have focused on using easily obtained materials and developing user-friendly techniques; our aim is to develop methods that will make e-textile technology available to crafters, students, and hobbyists. This paper describes the techniques and employs them as a springboard for a wider-ranging discussion of ``e-textile craft''.",

    abstract = { The design of textile touch sensing interaction was explored with the new metal composite embroidery yarns (MCEYs) and a simple and easy fabrication technique aimed towards robust and reliable pressure sensitive position sensors for wearable tangible interfaces. In this paper, the resistive sensing method of a potentiometer as an accurate positional indicator was chosen to make simple prototypes of MCEY embroidered touch sensors. A simple structure of embroidered potentiometer to create textile switches as an input device in a smart textile system was tested. Both one- and two-point sensing method were successfully demonstrated. A complete success rate on switching was observed. These simple but ingenious embroidered touch sensors showed the possibility of a soft, lightweight, flexible, freely foldable touchpad as a ubiquitous solution. It was also shown that these minimal fabrication technologies may be highly valued in the smart textile field thanks to their simplified interconnections, customizability and tailorability on double curvature surfaces. }

    abstract = { Many applications have been developed by taking advantage of the combined properties of rubber and textiles. For example, the shear behavior of rubber-coated fabrics is governed by the interaction of its two components, which is dependent on the yarn mobility. In this paper, the effect of coating penetration and thickness on the shear behavior is studied, along with the development of a combined lubrication theory and flow through a porous media model for coating penetration. For the shear deformation of the fabrics, nine types of woven PET fabrics are made and dip-coated multiple times in neoprene latex, with and without a coagulant agent. The results show that with the increase of coating thickness and penetration, the shear behavior becomes more similar to cord/textile embedded in rubber. The results from the modeling section suggest that a model can be developed to link the process and the material parameters to the ensuing coated fabric structure and its mechanical response. }

    abstract = { Conductive textiles are fabrics that include conductive yarns woven into or conductive tracks printed on to the textiles. Conductive textiles have attracted significant attention, since they are fundamental for the integration of electronic functions to achieve wearable devices. Screen printing is a well-established and cost-effective fabrication method; it enables a versatile layout of conductive tracks. The limitation of the current screen-printed conductive textiles is low durability to weathering, abrasion and washing. This paper presents a process for producing a waterproof and durable conductive textile using only screen printing. A three functional layer design was used to fabricate the durable conductive tracks. Firstly, an interface layer was printed to provide a smooth surface for subsequent printing, under-side protection and electrical insulation. Next, a silver layer provided the conductive track and finally an encapsulation layer was printed on top to provide upper-side protection and electrical insulation. The printed silver tracks achieved maximum conductivity using a single print. The conductivity of the silver tracks returned to its original value when they were dried after soaking in water continuously for 24 hours. }

    abstract = { Recent advances in shape memory alloys (SMAs) and shape memory polymers (SMPs) have inspired researchers to create intelligent textiles as self-regulating shape-changing structures responding to environmental variation, contributing to a new field in the scientific frontier of smart materials. This paper shows how appropriate shape memory training can engineer fabric designs to enhance their performance and their aesthetic appeal. Main technologies include the training procedure of shape memory effect (SME) in SMAs and SMPs, the regulation of phase transformation temperatures in SMAs, the manufacture of SMP yarns and SMP coating on fabrics for specific requirements of fabric design. Further attention is also paid to the combination of SMPs or SMAs with textile design of different fabric yarn for promoting specific dynamic aesthetic effects. }

abstract = {In this paper, we present textile sensors for the equipment of a wireless monitoring suit. The suit is intended for the monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration rate of children in a hospital environment. Special attention is given to the dedicated sensor interface circuits. The sensors, which are entirely fabricated out of textile, are integrated in a prototype belt of the monitoring suit. The complete suit will not contain only the sensors, but also the interface, data handling, storage and transmission electronics. Therefore, distributed, miniaturized circuitry, textile interconnections, a textile antenna and hermetic packaging are developed. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
